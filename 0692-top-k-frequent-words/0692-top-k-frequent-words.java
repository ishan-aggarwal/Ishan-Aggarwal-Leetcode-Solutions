    // Steps:
    // 1. Count the frequency of each word and store the records by a HashMap cnt. O(N)
    // 2. Define the sorting order as what the problem indicates (by frequencies from high to low, and then from lexicographically smaller ones     // to larger ones when we meet a tie in frequency) and sort the entire list of all words. O( N log N)
    // 3. Only return the first k words as the returned result.

        Time Complexity: O(Nlog‚Å°N). We count the frequency of each word in O(N) time, and then we sort the given words in O(NlogN) time.
        Space Complexity: O(N), the space used to store frequencies in a HashMap and return a slice from a sorted list of length O(N).
